# Data Science Capstone Project IBM - Space X Falcon 9 Landing Predictions

## Introduction

This capstone project focuses on predicting the successful landing outcomes of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. With SpaceX offering launches at a cost significantly lower than competitors, understanding the factors influencing the reusability of the first stage is crucial. This analysis aims to provide valuable insights into launch costs, benefiting companies considering competing with SpaceX in the rocket launch market.

## Objective

The ability of SpaceX to reuse the first stage of their Falcon 9 rocket is a key factor in reducing launch costs. This project aims to use Data Science to predict the probability of a successful landing of the first stage, thereby estimating the overall launch costs. The primary question is: What factors significantly affect the outcome of the first stage landing?
